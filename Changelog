Version 2.9 (Pre Release)
	- Build fixed for 32bit
	- Added IPv6 support provided by Francesco Prelz of INFN Milan
	- Fixed recursive listings

Version 2.8 2/10/14
	- Fixed SPOR response during striped third party transfers. SPOR will
	  pass all addresses returned from SPAS.
	- Fixed hang on server disconnect
	- On failure, do not attempt to remove destination file if it is a
	  block or character device
	- Added performance reporting for third-party transfers
	- Fixed EOF for multi striped client/server transfers

Version 2.7 11/26/12
	- Added a patch from Craig Tierney of NOAA to allow file size suffixes
	  'K', 'M', 'G' and 'T' so that values can be converted to kibibytes,
	  mebibytes, gibibytes and tebibytes, respectively. The chance has been
	  added to the command blksize, pbsz, tcpbuf, pput and pget.
	- Fixed byte transfer rate reporting after files are transferred but
	  zero bytes are actually transferred, as in 'pput 0 0 file'.
	- Fixed hang in extended mode retrieves
	- Added fix for globbing when using Globus GridFTP server 6.0 from
	  Globus Toolkit 5.1.2
	- Added support for 'SITE SETFAM'
	- Added support for 'SITE STAGE'
	- Added new interactive commands link, llink, symlink and lsymlink and
	  added -link and -symlink to the command line. Not supported by all
	  GridFTP servers. Symlink requires Globus 5.2.x.
	- Fixed how long the stage command will wait before retries
	- Changed MLSx processing of owner/group to use uid/gid when
	  owner/group equals '(null)'.
	- Now tries to maintain modification timestamps if the server supports it.
	  This is only supported on files.
	- Added 'cos' command (interactive and commandline) for setting the
	  class of service (used with HPSS installations).
	- Fixed build against Globus 5.2.x
	- Removed SETFAM, WIND, SITE BUFSIZE
	- Fixed EADDRNOTAVAIL bug on SLES10 when using port ranges
	- Fixed typos in the manpage
	- Added support for SITE SETCOS
	- The commands 'cos' and 'family' now take the value 'default' which
	  causes the server to decide which cos or family to use when files 
	  are stored.
	- Fixed reverse DNS looks for GSI name comparison.
	- Added new commands lscos/llscos to list available classes of service and
	  lsfam/llsfam to list available tape families.
	- Added hardlink support for the latest HPSS DSI
	- Added the ability 'put <file> /dev/null'.
	- Added check for "File not found" to MLST operations in order to support
	  dCache.
	- Support ALLO with ESTO (partial store).
	- Fixed offsets for partial transfers (pget,pput) in extended block mode (mode e)
	- Fixed 100% CPU usage during slow and 3rd party transfers.

Version 2.6 8/5/10
	- Fixed a segfault found on a UV10 running SLES11. The crash occurs
	  when the client tries to print out the server MOTD and the MOTD
	  has '%' embedded in it.

Version 2.5 9/08/09
	- Removed warnings at connect when service does not support MLST
	- Fixed directory listings on systems that do not support MLST
	- Removed mlsx usage from the manpage
	- No longer issue MLST/MLSD commands for parent directories unless
	  a regular expression is encountered. This is a slight performance
	  boost and a workaround for services that disallow access to parent
	  directories.
	- Fixed timestamps when listing in recursive or using regular
	  expressions. Timestamps are now shown in your local timezone.
	- Added check for src and dst URLs when using URL command line
	  transfer syntax
	- Fixed URL command line transfers when the destination is local
	- Fixed typos in 'put' help message and 'Unknown commad'

Version 2.4  4/17/09
	- Fixed a segfault in the stage command

Version 2.3  4/1/09
	- Added support for GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE, GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE,
	  UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE and UBERFTP_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE. The GLOBUS_*
	  versions are there for backwards compatibility. The UBERFTP_*
	  versions do the same things as their GLOBUS_* counterparts. The
	  UBERFTP_* versions will override the GLOBUS_* versions if both
	  are available.

Version 2.2  1/6/09
	- Fixed misspelling of argument
	- Added '-a <auth>' command line argument which only gives a warning
	  that it has been deprecated

Version 2.1  11/12/08
	- Fixed a bug where stdin was closed if local file wasn't opened
	  successfully during transfers
	- Fixed a build problem on OS X with the variable name 'wait'
	- Alphabetized the help menu
	- Added '?' command as an alias for help
	- Added runique/sunique for unique filenaming during transfers
	- directory listings can now be saved to a file
	- Added cdup/lcdup commands
	- Added 'glob' command and '-glob' commandline option to toggle 
	  filename expansion
	- Added '!' command to escape to a shell prompt
	- Changed precision of reported transfer rates
	- Moved the 'CHGRP' call to 'SITE CHGRP' since that is where NCSA's
	  mss has it and that is where it fits under globus servers
	- Comma can be used in addition to semi colons to delimit commands given
	  on the command line.
	- Fixed the misspelled word 'conneciton' in the manpage
	- Fixed FTP syntax for pget and pput functions
	- Fixed pget manpage entry for srcfile and destfile definitions
	- Fixed command piping in put commands by not coping stderr into the
	  resulting file
	- Fixed wildcards in pipe commands
	- Fixed 'put file directory'
	- Fixed offset used in cat/lcat
	- Changed 'quote setfam' & 'quote site setfam' to pass through to
	  the server first and then handle the response accordingly
	- Added polling when reading server responses to keep the client from
	  heavily using the CPU during 'quote stage 60'
	- Added --with-tcp-window to the configure script to allow the default
	  TCP window to be set specific to the host system
	- Added -with-blksize to the configure script to allow the default
	  internal buffer size to be set for optimal performance on the host system
	- Client will now truncate the local destination file if it exists
	- Changed data channel protection level to 'clear' to greatly improve
	  performance by default
	- Fix for NAME_MAX on AIX, now use pathconf()
	- Fix for lcd -
	- Fix for 'ALLO 0' on some 32 bit platforms
	- Fixed directory listings when using 'order' settings. The target
	  directory no longer appears in the output. './' is no longer
	  prefixed to 'ls' output. Target directories are now expanded in
	  the listing output.
	- Fixed default type when MLSD/MLST is not available
	- Destination file removed after transfer failure unless using
	  pget or pput
	- Adjusted the list output to be a bit more readable
	- rm and ls will continue after an error is encounted
	- UberFTP will attempt to stage a file before retrieval even if wait
	  is disabled. A more detailed message is returned to the user if the
	  file is not on disk.
	- recursive or regular expression transfers which transfer multiple
	  files will continue after errors are encountered until the current
	  command has completed



Version 2.0  8/06/08
	- Complete re write to fix some outstanding issues
	- No longer dependent upon globus ftp control libraries, only requires
	  the globus_gssapi_gsi library.
	- Added retry. Set this to the number of times you would like to retry
	  commands that fail with transient failures.
	- remove bget/bput and added 'retry' so all operations can recover
	- Added reconnect on connection timeout
	- Removed MSS authentication since it will be removed soon from NCSA's
	  mass storage system.
	- Removed the -a option to open. Now the authentication mechanism is
	  implied by the use a password
	- Now using MSLT/MLSD for recursive or globbing. The client will not
	  perform these operations for systems that do not support it.
	- cat, mkdir, rmdir, chmod, rm can take multiple targets
	- Added support for command piping the local target to get/put
	- Added chgrp
	- GSI code will now reuse the previously retrieved credential instead of
	  re retreiving it.
	- Checksums are now computed automatically after transfers if requested
	- Expanded command line options
	- Mkdir will not fail when the directory already exists if 
	  MLSx is supported
	- put -r will not fail when creating directories that already exist
	  if MLSx is supported
	- Added the 'family' command for setting tape family with FTP
	  services that support it
	- Added the 'resume' command. Give it the last attempted file transfer
	  or directory created during a failed recursive transfer and it will
	  skip to that target when you re run the recursive transfer
	- Added cksum which will compare local and remote CRC's
	- Added stage/lstage commands which take multiple objects. This also
	  suports recursion and regular expressions.
	- Control Channel keepalive is no optional and disabled by default
	- Added Data Channel Authentication and the command "dcau"
	- Added data channel encryption and the command "prot"
	- Added pbsz for changing the protection buffer size which is the maximum
	  encrypted message size on the data channel
	- Added a reconnect feature. If your connection has timed out or is dropped,
	  the client will reconnect you and preform your operation.
	- wait is now built into the client. This causes the client to attempt
	  to stage a file before downloading it.
	- Added size/lsize to give you the size of remote objects
	- Added ~ path expansion
	- Added 'cd -' capabilities

Version 1.27 02/8/08
	- Fixed bug were passive addresses were interpretted as IPv6 addresses
	- Flush out error messages so that the appear inline

Version 1.26 01/10/08
	- Rework of recursive operations to fix some failures
	- Destination directory must exist when transferring files

Version 1.25 07/24/07
	- 'quote stage' is now handled within the client to avoid firewall timeouts.
	- 'quote sum' no longer uses firewall timeouts

Version 1.24 04/27/07
	- Fixed parsing for -c option
	- Fix in filelist.h, filelist.c and ftpSession.h to fix build 
	  with xlc on AIX.

Version 1.23 02/16/07
	- Fixes for OSX including how optind is reset and dealing with
	  return values from strchr_r().

Version 1.22 10/23/06
	- Username/password authentication added to the commandline and the 
	  open/lopen commands. 
	- Username added to GSI authentication for advanced users that have 
	  multiple accounts that map to the same public key. 
	- Enhanced help menus with much more detail on each command. 
	- New keepalive issue added to data transfers to fix hanging issues related
	  to some firewalls. The client will now send 'NOP' to the server if it 
	  suspects that a problem has occurred. This fix is related (and in some 
	  situations requires the fix for) globus bug 4735. 
	- Added timeouts to fix server crash related hangs during data transfers. 
	- Fixed hangs caused by bad third-party transfers. If a problem occurs with
	  one service involved in the transfer, the connections are closed to 
	  prevent the client from haning. 
	- Enhanced error reporting and handling. Fixed exit values for various 
	  commands. Expanded the GSI related error messages to include more details.
	  Fixed the mput/mget return value for no match. Solved several memory 
	  leaks related to globus error objects and globus printable strings. 
	- Added URL style command line transfers. So now you can specify source 
	  and destination from the command line using one of the prefixes 
	  gsiftp://, file: or mss://. Or you can put source/destinations pairs in 
	  a file and use the -f option. 
	- Added the 'bugs' command to interactive mode which prints a short message
	  about who to send bugs and feature requests to. 
	- Added -m mode command line option to set the transfer mode to 'S' streams
	  mode or 'E' extended block mode. 
	- Added -versions command line option to print the version of all related 
	  globus libraries. 
	- Added debug information to directory listings for problem debugging. 
	- Rewrote the directory parsing to work with the Fermilab server. 
	- Added the recursive feature to mput and mget. These functions also allow
	  for multiple sources to be listed similar to the bput and bget functions. 
	- Rewrote lrm when not connected to a local service so that error messages
	  are printed instead of ignored. 
	- Added the 'order' interactive command to change the order of directory 
	  listings to to name, size or type. 
	- Added debug levels with differing amounts of output. This can be set from
	  the command line using the -D option or from the debug interactive 
	  command. 
 
Version 1.21 08/29/06 
	- It fixes a couple bugs in 1.20 including the lls bug on mercury (in 
	  which you see no listing) and the lcd bug (which causes a core dump).  

Version 1.20 07/21/06
	- Improved regular expressions. Version 1.19 only handled expressions in 
	  the last portion of the path. Version 1.20 allows the expression to be 
	  in any, or all, portions of the path. Added recursive listing and now 
	  you can use quotes and backslashes to work with file names with spaces.  

Version 1.19 03/15/06  
	- Includes a new recursive feature available with the rm, lrm, chmod, 
	  lchmod, get and put commands. Each of these commands accept the '-r' 
	  option to activate recursive mode. In recursive mode, get and put take 
	  directories as the source and destination rather than regular files. 
	  Be careful when using recursive in third-party transfers since a simple 
	  mistake such as incorrect permissions can cause the transfers to hang. 
	  This is a known deficiency in the FTP protocol which is exaggerated by 
	  the recursive feature. 
	- Fixes a hanging bug associated with pattern matching that was found 
	  when using rmdir and mput.  

Version 1.18 10/14/05
	- Fixed a segfault from improper use of vsnprintf() in SendCmd().  

Version 1.17 09/21/05
	- Added 'bye' as an alias to 'quit'.
	- It now handles bad PASV/SPAS responses which contain zero valid addresses.
	- Fixed the 'fixed-sized' buffers which truncated long commands and 
	- long pathnames.  

Version 1.16 08/29/05
	- Added support for third-party striping. Since the client is streams mode 
	  by default, you need to switch to extended block mode ('mode e' or 
	  'parallel x'). If the transfer has more than one stripe, a message is 
	  printed informing you of how many stripes are being used.
	- ALLO is no longer sent on partial transfers.
	- Removed server messages during transfers and replaced it with a 
	  completion message that gives the time elapsed, data transferred and rate.
	- Fixed SIZE usage to handle non existent files.
	- The local file is truncated when using 'get' to fix the 'zero-length 
	  transfer not overwriting the local file' bug.  

Version 1.15 08/10/05
	- Fixed the exit values for batch mode. If an error occurs, the client 
	  exits immediately with a value of 1. Otherwise it exits with a value of 
	  0 once all commands have finished executing. Interactive mode always 
	  exits with a value of 0.  

Version 1.14 08/5/05
	- rm/rmdir/lrm/lrmdir now handle regular expressions. These commands do not
	  accept the unix command flags ie. '-f', '-r'. Be careful when using rm 
	  because it uses DELE which will delete files AND directories.  

Version 1.13 03/25/05
	- Adds rename/lrename. 
	- A new manpage is included. 
	- Removed '-?' from the help menu because it doesn't work under tcsh. 
	- Added a new environment variable UBERFTP_ACTIVE_MODE. If set, it 
	  defaults to ACTIVE rather than passive mode which is essential for good 
	  performance when using NCSA's mass storage system. 
	- 'passive' no longer toggles passive/active modes, instead an 'active' 
	  command was added and each command sets (not toggles) the corresponding 
	  mode. 
	- 'OPT RETR PARALLELISM' has been changed to 'OPTS RETR Parallelism' to 
	  work around a case sensitiviy bug in the Globus's beta striping gridftp 
	  server.  

Version 1.12 02/22/05
	- Removes the 0 length local copy of a file when the user receives 
	  permission denied (if uberftp created the local copy).  

Version 1.11 09/9/04
	- Accepts code 125 when opening a data connection.  

Version 1.10 08/25/04
	- Fixes the strtoll() build problem on Tru64.  

Version 1.9 07/27/04
	- Adds a fix for tcpbuf.  

Version 1.8 07/26/04
	- 'tcpbuf <int>' will set the TCP buffer size.  

Version 1.7 06/25/04
	- ALLO support was added. 
	- username/password was removed. 
	- The -H option on the commandline or to open/lopen is optional so users 
	  can now specify 'uberftp mss.ncsa.uiuc.edu' which connects to mass 
	  storage using GSI on port 2811. 
	- 15 minute timeouts form the Globus gridftp server are now handled 
	  correctly.  

Version 1.6 05/6/04
	- UberFtp now defaults to passive streams mode to avoid firewall issues. If
	  you issue 'parallel x' where x >= 2, or perform third-party transfers, 
	  the client will use an active data connection. It will also failover to 
	  active if the service denies passive mode. This change will also be more 
	  efficient then the previous versions where it used extended block mode on
	  a single data channel.  

Version 1.5 04/22/04
	- Fixes build problems on AIX 5.x.  

Version 1.4 04/1/04
	- Fixes a build problem with Globus Toolkit 3.2 Beta.  

Version 1.3 12/8/03
	- Includes improved handling of directory listing commands. Now all 
	  options given to 'ls' are passed to the remote service. Note: this is 
	  not supported by all FTP implementations and this change only affects 
	  those implementations that can handle this feature.  

Version 1.2 12/8/03
	- Fixes a build problem on Solaris and a typo in a help message.  

Version 1.1 11/17/03
	- Fixes pget/pput offsets, removes '\r' from LIST output, removed pthr 
	  requirement, fixed crash caused when remote server sends empty responses.

Version 1.0 11/11/03
	- Version 1.0 is available for download.  

Version ALPHA_8_7 10/1/03
	- Added a rate message after completed transfers
	- Fix for the put bug 
	- Added the new command blksize which allows you to set the buffer and 
	  block size used in data transfers.  

Version ALPHA_8_6 09/24/03
	- Head on over to the downloads section.
