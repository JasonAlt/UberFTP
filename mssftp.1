mssftp \- File transfer program for NCSA's mass storage system
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RB [cmds]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "mssftp command"  ""  "\fLmssftp\fP \(em file transfer"
.IX GridFTP grid files transfer
.IX "file transfer protocol"  "mssftp command"  ""  "\fLmssftp\fP command"
.LP
.B mssftp 
is a GridFTP-enabled client that supports both interactive use and 
FTP commands on the command line to transfer files between NCSA's mass
storage system and the local system. It is based upon NCSA's UberFTP client.
\fBmssftp\fR supports GSI authentication, parallel data
channels and striping. For more information about GridFTP, see the GridFTP
URL in the "SEE ALSO" section below.

.B mssftp
connects only to NCSA's mass storage system (mss.ncsa.uiuc.edu). User
authentication is done without requiring a password, so you can
access the mass storage system from a batch job without putting the password
into a .netrc file.

Upon execution,
.B mssftp
immediately attempts to establish a connection to the FTP server
on  mss.ncsa.uiuc.edu. If no commands are given on the command, the client
will enter its command interpreter and await instructions from the user. If
commands are given on the commandline, the client will execute these commands
in order and exit upon the first error encountered or upon successful 
completion of all given commands. This list must be enclosed in quotes.
Multiple commands are semicolon or comma delimited.

.SH DEFAULT TRANSFER MODE
.LP
By default, without any special environment variables, command line options
or commands, \fBmssftp\fR will transfer files in ACTIVE STREAMS mode.
ACTIVE means that the server will initiate the data connection which increases
performance to NCSA's mass storage system. STREAMS mode implies that GRIDFTP
features including striping and parallel data connections are not used. In
order to take advantage of these features with GridFTP capable servers, you
must either change the mode directly using \-m command line switch or the 
.B mode
interactive command, or you can change the mode indirectly by specifying 
more than one parallel data connection using the \-c command line switch or
by using the
.B parallel
interactive command.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B ! [\fIcommand\fR]
Run the command using a shell on the local machine. If no command is given,
invoke an interactive shell.
.TP
.B ? [\fIcommand\fR]
If \fIcommand\fR is given, print a (hopefully) helpful blurb about it.
Otherwise, list all commands.
.TP
.B active
Change to ACTIVE mode which causes the server to initiate the data
connection. The is the default for mssftp.
If you are behind a firewall you must use PASSIVE mode.
.TP
.B ascii
Change the data transfer type to ASCII which causes the server to do some
simple transformations to the file being transferred. This is mostly useful
for changing EOL (end of line) in text files when moving between platforms.
This option is almost never necessary today. The default is BINARY mode
also known as IMAGE mode.
.TP
.B binary
Change the data transfer type to BINARY (aka IMAGE) which causes the server
to not perform transformations to the file being transferred. This is the
default and is faster than an ASCII transfer.
.TP
.B blksize \fIsize\fR
Change the size of the memory buffer used to read and write data to disks
to \fIsize\fR bytes. The default block size is 1024*1024 (1048576) bytes but it can be changed at compile time. The
block size can be increased to improve file transfer performance. This is
not related to the extended block mode block size used to determine the
ratio of data to header for data transferred on the data channel.

connection. The default is ACTIVE mode.  If you are behind a
firewall you must use PASSIVE mode.
.TP
.B pbsz [\fIsize\fR]
Change the length of the protection buffer. The protection buffer is used
to encrypt data on the data channel. The length of the protection buffer
represents the largest encoded message that is allowed on the data channel.
By default, the protection buffer is grown to match the internal buffer
used. For efficient transfers, pbsz should be sufficiently larger than
blksize so that the wrapped buffer fits within the protection buffer.
Otherwise, the blksize buffer is broken into multiple pieces so that each
write is less than pbsz when wrapped. If \fIpbsz\fR is not given, the
current size is displayed.

.br
         is not specified
.TP

This command configures the level of security on the data channel after
data channel authentication has completed. Clear means that the data will
not be protected. Safe means that the data will be integrity protected
meaning that altered data will be detected. Confidential means that the data

confidential and safe.
.br
\fIC\fR  Set protection level to clear.
.br
\fIS\fR  Set protection level to safe.
.br

.B pwd
Prints the current working directory.
.TP
.B quit
Close all control and data connections and exit.

.TP
.B retry [\fIcnt\fR]
Configures retry on failed commands that have transient errors. \fIcnt\fR
represents the number of times a failed command is retried. A value of
zero effectively disables retry. Zero is the default. If no value is given
the current setting is displayed.
.br
\fIcnt\fR    Number of times a failed command is retried.
.TP
.B resume [\fI-d\fR] \fIpath\fR

.SH IMPROVING FILE TRANSFER PERFORMANCE
.LP
When tranferring files over long distances, use a large value (for example, 
16777216) for \fBtcpbuf\fR.
When there is high network traffic, you may be able to improve 
performance using the \fBparallel\fR command to increase the number of
parallel data connections to 2-4.
.SH THIRD-PARTY TRANSFERS
.LP
All remote service commands have "l*" counterparts that allow you 
to specifiy that the command is to be performed on the local host. 

.SH CONTROLLING EPHEMERAL PORT SELECTION
.LP
By default, local port selection is managed by the operating system. However,
you may wish to specify which ports mssftp should use for incoming and
out going connections. This is useful when dealing with firewalls.

Setting UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE in your environment will cause all inbound
connections to use the specified port range. Likewise, setting
UBERFTP_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE in your environment will cause all outbound connections
to use the specified port range.

The environment variables GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
will also control the ephemeral port selection. These variables behave exactly
as their UBERFTP counterparts and are available for backwards compatibility with
older versions. The UBERFTP variables take precedence over the GLOBUS variables.

The values of the variables specify a port range, a minimum port number and a
maximum port number, separated by either a comma or a space. For example, to
set the inbound port range, you would set:

  UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000

Using the space delimiter, this format is also acceptable:

  UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE="40000 50000"

See your shell documentation for the proper syntax for settings variables within
your environment.

Setting the ephemeral port range to an unusable range will cause mssftp connections
to fail. For instance, setting a port range from 10 to 100 with a non root process will
fail on most operating systems.

.SH EXIT VALUES
.LP
mssftp will exit with a value of 0 if no errors occurred during the session,
otherwise it will exit with a value of 1. In non interactive, commandline mode,
it will exit after the first error occurs.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Connect to NCSA's mass storage system interactively from 
NCSA's TeraGrid cluster:

  % mssftp
  ...
  220 UNIX Archive FTP server ready.
  230 User consult logged in.
  ftp>

Use the command-line interface to copy a file from NCSA's TeraGrid cluster 
to the mass storage system:

  % mssftp "cd work; get file.tar"
