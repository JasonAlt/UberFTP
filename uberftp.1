.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "uberftp command"  ""  "\fLuberftp\fP \(em file transfer"
.IX GridFTP grid files transfer
.IX "file transfer protocol"  "uberftp command"  ""  "\fLuberftp\fP command"
.LP
.B uberftp 
is a GridFTP-enabled client that supports both interactive use and 
FTP commands on the \fBuberftp\fR command line to transfer files between two 
computers. It is intended for use with computers that have a GridFTP 
server installed. \fBUberftp\fR supports GSI authentication, parallel data
channels and striping. For more information about GridFTP, see the GridFTP
URL in the "SEE ALSO" section below.

Only the first usage shown above will create an interactive session. If
\fIhost\fR is specified,
.B uberftp
immediately attempts to establish a connection to the
.SM GridFTP
server on 
\fIhost\fR, 
enters its command interpreter and awaits commands from the user. If
\fIhost\fR is not specified,
.B uberftp
immediately drops into the command interpreter without connecting to any
.SM GridFTP
server.

The second usage option denotes a non interactive session in which
\*(lq\fIcmd\fR\*(rq
is a series of one or more commands as described in the 
.B COMMANDS
section below to run once the control connection is established. These 
commands are run exactly as if they had been entered from the interactive
prompt. This list must be enclosed in quotes. Multiple commands
are semicolon or comma delimited. uberftp will execute these commands and
then exit.
.B Uberftp
will exit upon the first error encountered.

The third and forth usage statements use the URL style format for specifying
the source and destination for the files to transfer. The third usage statement
places these URLs on the command line. The forth usage allows the user to 
specify multiple URL pairs in a separate file for
.B Uberftp
to transfer one at a time. The supported URL syntaxes are gsiftp://[user@]host[:port]/file,
ftp://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/file and file://path.

The fifth usage statement allows for commands that take pathnames to accept
URLs instead. The allowable commands are listed in the
.B -cmds
section below.

.SH HOST OPTIONS

.SH DEFAULT TRANSFER MODE
.LP
By default, without any special environment variables, command line options
or commands, \fBuberftp\fR will transfer files in PASSIVE STREAMS mode.
PASSIVE means that the client will initiate the data connection which is
useful for users behind firewalls. STREAMS mode implies that GRIDFTP features
including striping and parallel data connections are not used. In order to
take advantage of these features with GridFTP capable servers, you must either
change the mode directly using \-m command line switch or the 
.B mode
interactive command, or you can change the mode indirectly by specifying 
more than one parallel data connection using the \-c command line switch or
by using the
.B parallel
interactive command.

.SH GETTING YOUR GSI PROXY
.LP
.B By default, \fBuberftp\fR requires a GSI certificate. If you do not 
already have a certificate, see the following web page to learn how to get one:

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/UserInfo/Grid/Security/GetUserCert.html

Once you have a certificate, use the \fBgrid-proxy-init\fR command to get
a valid proxy.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B ! [\fIcommand\fR]
Run the command using a shell on the local machine. If no command is given,
invoke an interactive shell.
.TP
.B ? [\fIcommand\fR]
If \fIcommand\fR is given, print a (hopefully) helpful blurb about it.
Otherwise, list all commands.
.TP
.B active
Change to ACTIVE mode which causes the server to initiate the data
connection. The default is PASSIVE mode unless the variable
UBERFTP_ACTIVE_MODE is set in the environment. If you are behind a
firewall you must use PASSIVE mode.
.TP
.B ascii
Change the data transfer type to ASCII which causes the server to do some
simple transformations to the file being transferred. This is mostly useful
for changing EOL (end of line) in text files when moving between platforms.
This option is almost never necessary today. The default is BINARY mode
also known as IMAGE mode.
.TP
.B binary
Change the data transfer type to BINARY (aka IMAGE) which causes the server
to not perform transformations to the file being transferred. This is the
default and is faster than an ASCII transfer.
.TP
.B blksize \fIsize\fR
Change the size of the memory buffer used to read and write data to disks
to \fIsize\fR bytes. The default block size is 1024*1024 (1048576) bytes but it can be changed at compile time. The
block size can be increased to improve file transfer performance. This is
not related to the extended block mode block size used to determine the
ratio of data to header for data transferred on the data channel.

.SH IMPROVING FILE TRANSFER PERFORMANCE
.LP
Use the \fBactive\fR command to enable \fIactive\fR mode FTP when 
using NCSA's UniTree mass storage system if possible since it 
will give much better file transfer performance.
When tranferring files over long distances, use a large value (for example, 
16777216) for \fBtcpbuf\fR.
When there is high network traffic, you may be able to improve 
performance using the \fBparallel\fR command to increase the number of
parallel data connections to 2-4.
.SH THIRD-PARTY TRANSFERS
.LP
In order to perform a third-party transfer, you must log into two 
\fBFTP\fR servers. Typically, you connect to a single \fBFTP\fR service to 
"get" files to the local machine and "put" files to the remote service. 
For third-party transfers, you must connect to a second service 
thereby replacing the former local machine. In \fBUberFTP\fR terminology, 
it is referred to as "opening a new local service" since, from 
the perspective of the user, the new local service will appear 
as though the user initiated the FTP session from that machine. 

All remote service commands have "l*" counterparts that allow you 
to specify that the command is to be performed on the local service, 
whether that service is the local machine or a new local service. 
So to open a new local service, use the "l*" version of the open command: 

  UberFTP> lopen mss.ncsa.teragrid.org
  UberFTP> lclose
      
Once you have connected to both services, files can be transferred as 
before with the change that files you "get" go to the new local service 
and files you "put" are sent from the new local service. 
.SH CONTROLLING EPHEMERAL PORT SELECTION
.LP
By default, local port selection is managed by the operating system. However,
you may wish to specify which ports UberFTP should use for incoming and 
out going connections. This is useful when dealing with firewalls.

Setting UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE in your environment will cause all inbound
connections to use the specified port range. Likewise, setting
UBERFTP_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE in your environment will cause all outbound connections
to use the specified port range.

The environment variables GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
will also control the ephemeral port selection. These variables behave exactly
as their UBERFTP counterparts and are available for backwards compatibility with
older versions. The UBERFTP variables take precedence over the GLOBUS variables.

The values of the variables specify a port range, a minimum port number and a
maximum port number, separated by either a comma or a space. For example, to
set the inbound port range, you would set:

  UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000

Using the space delimiter, this format is also acceptable:

  UBERFTP_TCP_PORT_RANGE="40000 50000"

See your shell documentation for the proper syntax for settings variables within
your environment.

Setting the ephemeral port range to an unusable range will cause UberFTP connections
to fail. For instance, setting a port range from 10 to 100 with a non root process will
fail on most operating systems.

.SH EXIT VALUES
.LP
UberFTP will exit with a value of 0 if no errors occurred during the session,
otherwise it will exit with a value of 1. In non interactive, commandline mode,
it will exit after the first error occurs.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Set the environment variable to set \fIactive\fR mode FTP 
(improves file transfer performance to the mass storage system).
Connect to NCSA's UniTree mass storage system interactively from 
NCSA's TeraGrid cluster:

  setenv UBERFTP_ACTIVE_MODE on
  % uberftp mss.ncsa.teragrid.org
  ...
  220 UNIX Archive FTP server ready.
  230 User consult logged in.
  UberFTP>

Use the command-line interface to copy a file from NCSA's TeraGrid cluster 
to the UniTree mass storage system. (There is no need to set
\fBtcpbuf\fR since it is over a LAN but \fIactive\fR mode is turned on
to improve file transfer performance to the mass storage system.):

  uberftp mss.ncsa.teragrid.org \\
     "active; cd work; get file.tar"

Copy a file from SDSC's TeraGrid cluster to NCSA's TeraGrid cluster.
(Note that \fBtcpbuf\fR is set to 16777216 since there is a long
network latency between NCSA and SDSC):

  uberftp tg-gridftp.sdsc.teragrid.org \\
     "tcpbuf 16777216; cd scr; put file.tar"
